# Usage

Unless specified otherwise you are allowed to take anything I post and use it in any way you want provided that

- You aren't just copying it and put effort into changing it

- It does not contain my face/voice

- You credit me

- You make no profit off of it

- You are not a company

- You allow anyone to edit it under the same conditions as specified here

- You provide a link to the original, a template or a file that would allow people to easily edit the produced work (e.i a .psd), if you have trouble finding the original or a template please contact me and I'll provide it

If what you want to do doesn't meet this criteria you must gain my express permission to do so
